            <h3>Individual Peer Counseling</h3>
            <p>Peer counseling can offer students a relaxed and laid back place to vent and find support. We are able to listen and relate, as well as give you a judgment-free space to talk out your thoughts. Students have reported appreciating having someone outside of their immediate circle to talk to as well as someone who is able to support them in working through personal challenges.</p>

            <h3>Togetherall</h3>
            <p>Recognizing that some students who are feeling isolated, depressed, or anxious may find it challenging to connect with our resources and verbally express their needs, Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is pleased to announce the piloting of Togetherall, an online, anonymous peer-support tool available for free to our students. Togetherall is a clinically moderated, online peer-to-peer mental health community that reaches and empowers a diverse population of students to anonymously seek and provide support</p>
